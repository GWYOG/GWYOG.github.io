Welcome
=======
This is a blog which I use to write down some private things and share my own experience on many things. These words may be somehow subjective, which means that they are likely to be wrong and mislead others. However, if you are really interested in the topic, I will give you a warm welcome since these words are really what I'm eager to express and expected to be seen by a small amount of people. Really paradoxical, isn't it?  
(But if some of these words are mature to see the sunlight, I may release them to Baidu Postbar someday.)

This license may be a little bit rigid. But I think it may be the most suitable one since the words are subjective and may not be suitable for everyone.  
It's just a blog, not a tutorial or a wiki, isn't it?
